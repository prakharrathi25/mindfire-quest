#  Mindfire Quest
> Unveil the obscure network of company and location data, using smart algorithms and data wrangling

## Mission Statement

By transforming Swiss Re into a truly tech- and data-led risk knowledge company, we aim to make an incremental change in better understanding and qualifying risks. Reflecting the real-world evidence in a systematic, digital way, for example understanding where companies have their offices, facilities, factories, and warehouses, is essential to perform risk assessment and resilience services in a data-driven way. While meta information on companies does exist, an extended view to its locations isn’t solved at scale yet. This quest aims to bridge this major information gap applying advanced techniques with artificial intelligence.


The quest's mission  is to build relationships in company and location data. In particular, it will focus on:

* Defining the many ways in which a company and a location (for example a factory, warehouse, sales point) can be interlinked
* Identifying free or paid source of information, where data would support applying  ontology to actual companies and buildings
* Populating a first applied ontology with information retrieved from commercially-free data
* Potentially retrieving unique identifiers when and where possible, to allow Swiss Re to  map it to its internal data at a later stage

## Methods 

The methods that we have applied have been discussed in the following section: 

1. NLP Ontology: DNB & DUNS; Panama, Paradise and Pandora papers for offshore and virtual address, or the Global cement directory report 

2. Top View: Semantic image search using, e.g. CLIP (from OpenAI) applied to sat and terrain view repos of North America, Africa etc.
a) Library used: CLIP Notebook 
b) Library Used: Google MUM Multi-Modal T5 
c) Library Used: CV modals on TF or Sagemaker...

3. Sat View: Text Extraction of company names from the buildings or building entrances signs, potentially for inclined sat view. 
(Cement factory company_detection from image)

The following solutions are for crowdsourcing company annotations:

4. Google PlusCODES, SearchOn: coordinate numbering system for buildings

5. E.g. via Nantic’s now open sourced lightning dev environment, or similar to Google Captchas...
